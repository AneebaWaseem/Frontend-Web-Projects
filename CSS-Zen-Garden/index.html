            <h1>The Road to Enlightenment</h1><br><br>
            <p>Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of browser-specific tags, incompatible <abbr
                    title="Document Object Model">DOMs</abbr>, broken <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>
                support, and abandoned browsers.</p><br>
            <p>We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has been achieved thanks to the tireless efforts of
                folk like the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>, <abbr
                    title="Web Standards Project">WaSP</abbr>, and the major browser creators.</p><br>
            <p>The CSS Zen Garden invites you to relax and meditate on the important lessons of the masters. Begin to
                see with clarity. Learn to use the time-honored techniques in new and invigorating fashion. Become one
                with the web.</p><br>

            <h1>So What is This About?</h1><br><br>
            <p>There is a continuing need to show the power of <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>. The Zen
                Garden aims to excite, inspire, and encourage participation. To begin, view some of the existing designs
                in the list. Clicking on any one will load the style sheet into this very page. The HTML remains the
                same, the only thing that has changed is the external <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>
                file. Yes, really.</p><br>
            <p><abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> allows complete and total control over the style of a
                hypertext document. The only way this can be illustrated in a way that gets people excited is by
                demonstrating what it can truly be, once the reins are placed in the hands of those able to create
                beauty from structure. Designers and coders alike have contributed to the beauty of the web; we can
                always push it further.</p><br>

        <div>
            <h1>Participation</h1><br><br>
            <p>Strong visual design has always been our focus. You are modifying this page, so strong <abbr
                    title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> skills are necessary too, but the example files are
                commented well enough that even <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> novices can use them as
                starting points. Please see the <a href="https://www.csszengarden.com/pages/resources/"><abbr
                        title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> Resource Guide</a> for advanced tutorials and tips on
                working with <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>.</p><br>
            <p>You may modify the style sheet in any way you wish, but not the <abbr
                    title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>. This may seem daunting at first if you’ve never
                worked this way before, but follow the listed links to learn more, and use the sample files as a guide.
            </p><br>
            <p>Download the sample <a href="https://www.csszengarden.com/examples/index">HTML</a> AND <a
                    href="https://www.csszengarden.com/examples/style.css">CSS</a> to work on a copy locally. Once you
                have completed your masterpiece (and please, don’t submit half-finished work) upload your <abbr
                    title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> file to a web server under your control. <a
                    href="https://www.csszengarden.com/pages/submit/">Send us a link</a> to an archive of that file and
                all associated assets, and if we choose to use it we will download it and place it on our server.</p>

            <p>Why participate? For recognition, inspiration, and a resource we can all refer to showing people how
                amazing <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> really can be. This site serves as equal parts
                inspiration for those working on the web today, learning tool for those who will be tomorrow, and
                gallery of future techniques we can all look forward to.</p>

    <section id="Requirements">
        <div>
            <h1>Requirements</h1><br><br>
            <p>Where possible, we would like to see mostly <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> 1 & 2 usage.
                <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> 3 & 4 should be limited to widely-supported elements
                only, or strong fallbacks should be provided. The <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> Zen
                Garden is about functional, practical <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> and not the latest
                bleeding-edge tricks viewable by 2% of the browsing public. The only real requirement we have is that
                your <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> validates.
            </p><br>
            <p>Luckily, designing this way shows how well various browsers have implemented <abbr
                    title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> by now. When sticking to the guidelines you should see
                fairly consistent results across most modern browsers. Due to the sheer number of user agents on the web
                these days — especially when you factor in mobile — pixel-perfect layouts may not be possible across
                every platform. That’s okay, but do test in as many as you can. Your design should work in at least IE9+
                and the latest Chrome, Firefox, iOS and Android browsers (run by over 90% of the population).</p><br>
            <p>We ask that you submit original artwork. Please respect copyright laws. Please keep objectionable
                material to a minimum, and try to incorporate unique and interesting visual themes to your work. We’re
                well past the point of needing another garden-related design.</p><br>
            <p>This is a learning exercise as well as a demonstration. You retain full copyright on your graphics (with
                limited exceptions, see <a href="https://www.csszengarden.com/pages/submit/guidelines/">submission
                    guidelines</a>), but we ask you release your <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> under a
                Creative Commons license identical to the <a
                    href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/">one on this site</a> so that others may
